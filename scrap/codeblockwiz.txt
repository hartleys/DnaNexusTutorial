    DNAnexus App Wizard, API v1.0.0
    
    Basic Metadata
    
    Please enter basic metadata fields that will be used to describe your app.
    Optional fields are denoted by options with square brackets.  At the end of
    this wizard, the files necessary for building your app will be generated
    from the answers you provide.
    
    The name of your app must be unique on the DNAnexus platform.
    After creating your app for the first time, you will be able to publish new
    versions using the same app name.  App names are restricted to alphanumeric
    characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), and the characters ".", "_", and "-".
    App Name: findNi
    The directory findNi already exists.  Would you like to remove all of its con                                                                                                 tents and create a new directory in its place? [y/n]: y
    Replacing all contents of directory findNi...
    
    The title, if provided, is what is shown as the name of your app on
    the website.  It can be any valid UTF-8 string.
    Title []: Find Ni
    
    The summary of your app is a short phrase or one-line description
    of what your app does.  It can be any UTF-8 human-readable string.
    Summary []: Finds words that begin with ni
    
    You can publish multiple versions of your app, and the version of
    your app is a string with which to tag a particular version.  We encourage
    the use of Semantic Versioning for labeling your apps (see
    http://semver.org/ for more details).
    Version [0.0.1]: 0.0.1
    
    Input Specification
    
    You will now be prompted for each input parameter to your app.  Each
    parameter should have a unique name that uses only the underscore "_" and
    alphanumeric characters, and does not start with a number.
    
    1st input name (<ENTER> to finish): wordsFile
    Label (optional human-readable name) []: File of all words
    Your input parameter must be of one of the following classes:
    applet         array:file     array:record   file           int
    array:applet   array:float    array:string   float          record
    array:boolean  array:int      boolean        hash           string
    
    Choose a class (<TAB> twice for choices): file
    This is an optional parameter [y/n]: n
    
    2nd input name (<ENTER> to finish):
    
    Output Specification
    
    You will now be prompted for each output parameter of your app.  Each
    parameter should have a unique name that uses only the underscore "_" and
    alphanumeric characters, and does not start with a number.
    
    1st output name (<ENTER> to finish): outfile
    Label (optional human-readable name) []: Output file of words
    Choose a class (<TAB> twice for choices): file
    
    2nd output name (<ENTER> to finish):
    
    Timeout Policy
    
    Set a timeout policy for your app. Any single entry point of the
    app that runs longer than the specified timeout will fail with a
    TimeoutExceeded error. Enter an int greater than 0 with a single-letter
    suffix (m=minutes, h=hours, d=days) (e.g. "48h").
    Timeout policy [48h]: 48h
    
    Template Options
    
    You can write your app in any programming language, but we provide
    templates for the following supported languages: Python, bash
    Programming language: bash
    
    Access Permissions
    If you request these extra permissions for your app, users will see this
    fact when launching your app, and certain other restrictions will apply.
    For more information, see
    https://wiki.dnanexus.com/App-Permissions.
    
    Access to the Internet (other than accessing the DNAnexus API).
    Will this app need access to the Internet? [y/N]: N
    
    Direct access to the parent project. This is not needed if your app
    specifies outputs,     which will be copied into the project after it's
    done running.
    Will this app need access to the parent project? [y/N]: N

    Default instance type: The instance type you select here will apply
    to all entry points in your app unless you override it. See
    https://wiki.dnanexus.com/API-Specification-v1.0.0/Instance-Types
    for more information.

    *** Generating DNAnexus App Template... ***
    
    Your app specification has been written to the dxapp.json file. You can
    specify more app options by editing this file directly (see
    https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal for complete documentation).
    
    Created files:
             findNi/Readme.developer.md
             findNi/Readme.md
             findNi/dxapp.json
             findNi/resources/
             findNi/src/
             findNi/src/findNi.sh
             findNi/test/
    
    App directory created!  See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal for
    tutorials on how to modify these files, or run "dx build findNi" or "dx
    build --create-app findNi" while logged in with dx.
    
    Running the DNAnexus build utility will create an executable on the
    DNAnexus platform.  Any files found in the resources directory will
    be uploaded so that they will be present in the root directory when the
    executable is run.
