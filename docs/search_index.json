["wiz.html", "4 The App Builder Wizard:", " 4 The App Builder Wizard: The first step is to create a new App. You can generate the files from a template, write them yourself, or you can use the dx app creation wizard. For your first project, I recommend the last option. dx-app-wizard DNAnexus App Wizard, API v1.0.0 Basic Metadata Please enter basic metadata fields that will be used to describe your app. Optional fields are denoted by options with square brackets. At the end of this wizard, the files necessary for building your app will be generated from the answers you provide. The name of your app must be unique on the DNAnexus platform. After creating your app for the first time, you will be able to publish new versions using the same app name. App names are restricted to alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), and the characters \".\", \"_\", and \"-\". App Name: findNi The title, if provided, is what is shown as the name of your app on the website. It can be any valid UTF-8 string. Title []: Find Ni The summary of your app is a short phrase or one-line description of what your app does. It can be any UTF-8 human-readable string. Summary []: Finds words that begin with ni You can publish multiple versions of your app, and the version of your app is a string with which to tag a particular version. We encourage the use of Semantic Versioning for labeling your apps (see http://semver.org/ for more details). Version [0.0.1]: 0.0.1 Input Specification You will now be prompted for each input parameter to your app. Each parameter should have a unique name that uses only the underscore \"_\" and alphanumeric characters, and does not start with a number. 1st input name (&lt;ENTER&gt; to finish): wordsFile Label (optional human-readable name) []: File of all words Your input parameter must be of one of the following classes: applet array:file array:record file int array:applet array:float array:string float record array:boolean array:int boolean hash string Choose a class (&lt;TAB&gt; twice for choices): file This is an optional parameter [y/n]: n 2nd input name (&lt;ENTER&gt; to finish): Output Specification You will now be prompted for each output parameter of your app. Each parameter should have a unique name that uses only the underscore \"_\" and alphanumeric characters, and does not start with a number. 1st output name (&lt;ENTER&gt; to finish): outfile Label (optional human-readable name) []: Output file of words Choose a class (&lt;TAB&gt; twice for choices): file 2nd output name (&lt;ENTER&gt; to finish): Timeout Policy Set a timeout policy for your app. Any single entry point of the app that runs longer than the specified timeout will fail with a TimeoutExceeded error. Enter an int greater than 0 with a single-letter suffix (m=minutes, h=hours, d=days) (e.g. \"48h\"). Timeout policy [48h]: 48h Template Options You can write your app in any programming language, but we provide templates for the following supported languages: Python, bash Programming language: bash Access Permissions If you request these extra permissions for your app, users will see this fact when launching your app, and certain other restrictions will apply. For more information, see https://wiki.dnanexus.com/App-Permissions. Access to the Internet (other than accessing the DNAnexus API). Will this app need access to the Internet? [y/N]: N Direct access to the parent project. This is not needed if your app specifies outputs, which will be copied into the project after it's done running.

You can specify more app options by editing this file directly (see https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal for complete documentation). Created files: findNi/Readme.developer.md findNi/Readme.md findNi/dxapp.json findNi/resources/ findNi/src/ findNi/src/findNi.sh findNi/test/ App directory created! See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal for tutorials on how to modify these files, or run \"dx build findNi\" or \"dx build --create-app findNi\" while logged in with dx. Running the DNAnexus build utility will create an executable on the DNAnexus platform. Any files found in the resources directory will be uploaded so that they will be present in the root directory when the executable is run. Since the wizard is interactive, I have already performed this step and the example directory contains a copy of the output: cp -R ../examples/findNi_original ./ex/findNi "],
